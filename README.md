# Scratch JSON

 This Scratch 3.0 custom extension adds blocks to access and controls the JSON.

## IMPORTANT

 Here are something you should know before using this extension in a project.

 1. The technical limitations of custom extension

    > Due to technical limitations of the sandbox, every call to a custom extension will stop the current script for a full frame, regardless of turbo mode or run without screen refresh.

    (extracted from [TurboWarp Documentation](https://docs.turbowarp.org/development/custom-extensions))

    This means every custom extension block will act like an empty "wait () seconds" block but do not affected by turbo mode or custom block (run without screen refresh).

 2. The stability of this extension

    Due to any possible bugs and various uncertainties, I can not promise there will not have any breaking changes affecting the projects, so I created a "version" folder in this repository to store every version of the extension.

    Use the file in the "version" folder for a project instead:  
    `https://bill96012.github.io/scratch-json-extension/version/(version).js`

## Blocks

### Get (PATH) from (JSON)

 Reporter block.  
 Returns the value of (PATH) in (JSON).

### Set (PATH) in (JSON) to (VALUE)

 Reporter block.  
 Returns the (JSON) which value of (PATH) has modified to (VALUE).

### Delete (PATH) from (JSON)

 Reporter block.  
 Returns the (JSON) which value of (PATH) has removed.

### Length of array (PATH) from (JSON)

 *(added from v1.1.0)*  
 Reporter block.  
 Returns the length of the array (PATH) in (JSON), return "0" if (PATH) is not an array.

### (JSON) has (PATH) ?

 Boolean block.  
 Returns "true" if (JSON) has (PATH), else "false".

### (INPUT) is valid JSON?

 Boolean block.  
 Returns "true" if (INPUT) is valid JSON, else "false".

## Notes

### Path

 `.` - Separate all the sub keys

 ```text
 a.b
 x.y.z
 ```

 `\` - Escape the `.` and `\` after it  
 *Don't forget to use the boolean block "( ) is valid JSON?" to check the escaped key.*

```text
a.b      ->  'a',   'b'
x\.y.z   ->  'x.y', 'z'
i\\\..j  ->  'i\.', 'j'
```

 `[n]` - Index of the array, `n` must be an integer

```text
a[0]
x[1][3][5]
```

 It is possible to create a complex path

```text
a.b[0]
x[9].y[0][3].z
```
